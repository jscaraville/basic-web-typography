    <h2>The lack of racial diversity in graphic design is tied to the pedagogy of design itself.</h2>
    <h3>At design schools, foundation courses teach a clearly Western European approach rooted in Modernism.</h3>
    <h4>Design history, as it is taught in those settings, renders racial whiteness invisible through an erasure of social context.</h4>
    <h5>By isolating creative movements and individual creators, design pedagogy supports the myth of individual exceptionalism, while the Western-centric approach implies racial essentialism.</h5>
    <h6>Combined with validating its design aesthetic through theory, this results in a visual language that can exclude and invalidate the perspectives of non-whites.</h6>
    <p>How can a profession hope to attract people of color when the requirements are to assimilate, internalize, and perpetuate white hegemony?</p>
